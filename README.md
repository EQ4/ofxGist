Gist

Gist is a C++ audio analysis library intended for use in real-time applications. It contains a range of audio analysis algorithms, including:

* Simple Time Domain Features (e.g. RMS, Zero Crossing Rate)
* Simple Frequency Domain Features (e.g. Spectral Centroid, Spectral Flatness)
* Onset Detection Functions (e.g. Energy Difference, Complex Spectral Difference)
* Pitch Detection
* Mel-frequency Representations (e.g. Mel-frequency Spectrum, MFCCs)
